# Week 10-Technigo bootcamp 

# Survey form with React

This project, "About your plants" survey, was made as a Week 10 project for Technigo bootcamp. The aim of this project was to learn the purpose of state in React, use the useState hook in React, learn how to connect HTML form inputs to state and use form fields with React.

## The problem

The toughest part was to show different components based on where you are in the survey, but I solved it with a separate button component that was imported to each of the component displayed on separate page. I quite quickly reached the blue level, so I spend some extra time on making red and black features such as progress bar to visualize to the users how far through the survey they and how much is left. Moreover, I created a range slider from 0 to 10 and connected it to React state. If I had more time, I would also show different questions depending on the answer to a specific question, but I am not sure it is so easy applied to my topic.
